His father left him large tracts of land when he died. But Rama Natha did not spend even one day looking after his land. This was because he had a funny ideahe believed there was a magic potion that could turn any object into gold. He spent all his time to learn more about this potion. People cheated him often, promising to tell him about it, but he did not give up . His wife, Madhumati, was tired of this and also worried because she saw how much money Rama Natha was spending. She was sure that soon they would be without money. One day, a famous sage called Mahipati came to their town. Rama Natha became his follower and asked him about the potion. To his surprise the sage answered, Yes, in my travels in the Himalayas, I heard how you could make such a potion. But it is difficult. Tell me! requested Rama Natha, not believing his luck. You have to plant a banana plant and water it regularly with your hands. In winter, the morning dew is on the leaves. You have to collect the dew and store it in a bottle. When you have five litres of dew, bring it to me. I will chant some magic words, which will turn it into the magic potion.

She came with a big box. When she opened it, inside shined stacks of gold coins! Now the sage turned to the very surprised Rama Natha and said, There is no magic potion that can turn things into gold. You worked hard on your land and created this plantation. While you looked after the trees, your wife sold the fruits in the market. Thats how you got this money. It was your hard work that created this wealth, not magic. If I had told you about this earlier, you would have not listened to me, so I played a trick on you.
