Sometime back, when my brother had measles, the doctor told us to put neem leaves on his bed and make him lie down on them. Can you explain why? Neem Baba : The doctors know that neem leaves have chemical properties that destro y germs. Measles cause itching all over the body. Neem leaves give comfort and do not allow germs to breed. Neem leaves, bark, flowers, fruits and even roots can be used to make medicines to cure many diseases. twigs: small thin branches measles : disease with fever and red spots on skin itching: feeling the need to scratch breed : grow Unit .indd  -Dec- :: PM Reprint - Nurturi Ng NatureAmber : Yes, I once had a cough and I could not breathe properly . My grandmother cured me with a medicine made from neem bark. And when my father had itching in the eyes, she prepared a kajal from neem flowers, which cured him. Neem Baba : Oh, little Amber, you know so much. Remember, these remedies are to be used only by people who are well trained and have a lot of experience. Amber : Yes, I will. Tell me Neem Baba, is there any use of neem for the farmers? Neem Baba : Yes. If the powder of neem seeds is mixed in water and spra yed on plants and trees, then locusts dont eat them. If it is used in rice fields, where water remains standing, it stops mosquito breeding and helps to increase crop yield. It also saves the crop from termites, which eat roots of the crop, and it also stops breeding of other insects that eat crops. Amber : Tha t means, if we put the powder of neem seeds in stagnant water around our homes, mosquitoes locusts: flying insects that damage crops 79termites : insects that damage wood and buildings stagnant: not flowing Unit .indd  -Dec- :: PM Reprint -  Poorvi G rade 6wont breed in them!

I am happy that the natural cures that I had shared, helped you. You should try to remember these cures and may share them with your friends. When I was a child, I learnt them from my grandmother. She used to find home remedies for most of the weather-related common illnesses. Let me share some of the benefits of the spices that most of us have in our kitchen. Let me start with haldi, which is called turmeric in English. It helps in improving our energy level and digestion. It helps in reducing body pain too. Next, let us take methi, which is called fenugreek in English. You will be surprised to know that it helps me in keeping my sugar level and my body weight in control. I need to soak the methi seeds overnight and drink the water in the morning.  Jeera (cumin) seeds soaked in water overnight can also improve digestion and help cure sleeplessness.  You know, when you were babies and had gas in your tummy, I used to put heeng (asafoetida) water on your tummy to give you some relief. Heeng can also help in controlling cough and cold.  Dalchini (cinnamon) and laung (clove) give relief when we have toothache till we can consult a dentist.  Adrak (ginger) is another herb that can help us when we have cough and cold. It also gives relief from pain. Do you know, ginger has been used in cooking for more than  years? Even today, it is extensively used in cooking Indian food.  Kali mirch (black pepper) is also helpful in digestion and can give us relief from body pain.  You may have seen that at the end of a meal, saunf (fennel seeds) and ajwain (carom seeds) are served. It is because they help in the digestion of food.  Elaichi (cardamom) also helps us with digestion and respiratory troubles in addition to curing bad breath. III Do you know if these spices can be used for something else other than cooking? Let us find out by reading the letter given below.
