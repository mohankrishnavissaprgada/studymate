Let me tell you a unique dish of my district. It is called gakkad bharta. First, we make gakkad from wheat dough. Then, we make balls with that dough and roast them on high heat. To make bharta, we roast brinjals and tomatoes. Then we garnish the bharta with chopped onions, coriander, green chillis and salt. This food item is made without frying. To eat it, you simply crumble the gakkad and drizzle it with some bharta and a spoonful of ghee. Come to Jabalpur and try it! You will listen to the audio or narration once again.
