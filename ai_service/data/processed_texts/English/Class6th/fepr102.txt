The king was fond of Gajaraj, and he had ordered that the elephant should be well looked after. In spite of royal comforts, Gajaraj was sad because he had no friends. The mahout, or elephant trainer, was the only one he ever interacted with . The mahout was a kind man who served Gajaraj food, and gave him a bath in the elephant pond daily. He was a good caretaker, but not a friend. I wish I had a friend I can play with, thought Gajaraj. One late evening, a dog strayed into the stable.

The next morning, the mahout found the stray dog in the stable. He did not mind the dog. He also noticed that Gajaraj seemed to like the company. So, he threw some crumbs to the dog, which the animal accepted wagging his tail. When the elephant went out for a bath, the dog accompanied his friend. Plunging into the water, the elephant gave himself a shower using his long trunk, as the dog watched. The elephant took a trunkful of water and playfully splashed the water on his friend. The dog yelped for he hated taking showers.

The farmer hugged the dog and told the mahout that he was looking for his dog ever since he disappeared from his house. He was glad he found him now.

Now, the mahout was worried. He ran his hand on Gajarajs tummy and felt there was nothing wrong. Why was he not eating then? Is he missing his friend, that dog? the mahout wondered. Meanwhile at the farmers house, the dog had also not touched his food ever since he was brought home. Are you missing your friend? asked the farmer remembering the happy look on Buntees face while sitting on the elephants back.
